Here i save some of my dotfiles i use in my .config directory.
It contains mostly config files for working with i3 and making it more convenient.

All folders in this repo need to be places under .config

EXCEPTION:
 - The xterm folder which contains a XResources file which need to be placed in the home directory as a hidden file.
 - The intel_backlight folder contains a fix to make xbacklight work with the intel driver. place the xorg.conf file in /etc/X11 to make it work.
